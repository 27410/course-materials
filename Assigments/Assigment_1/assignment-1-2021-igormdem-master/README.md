# Metabolism at a glance - Assignment
## Black box model

In a batch fermentation experiment:

* a 2 L fermentor was inoculated with 0.02 g DW/L of yeast.
* Initial glucose concentration was 20 g/L.

At the end of the exponential growth phase, it was found that 

* the medium contained 10 g/L ethanol,
* 2.74 g DW/L biomass and
* 1.54 g/L glycerol. 
* The final glucose concentration was practically 0 g/L.

In `assignment.py`:
1. Calculate the specific yield coefficients (C-mol) for all products. 
2. Calculate the carbon balance.
3. Assuming that CO2 is the only missing product, calculate how much CO2 was produced in the fermentation.

Hint: Assume the following average biomass elemental composition (Villadsen et al., p. 74):
